Description: TumourMethData collects tumour methylation data from a variety of different tumour types (and also matching normal samples where available) and produced with 
	different technologies (e.g. WGBS, RRBS and methylation arrays) and provides them as RangedSummarizedExperiments. This facilitates easy extraction of methylation data for regions of interest
	across different tumour types and studies.
